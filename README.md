- 👋 Hi, I’m [*@vectorZeng*](https://vectorzeng.github.io/)
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, control science, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and mathematical modeling.
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergraduate student, so my codes might be naive.
- 💞️ There is a long way ahead, and there are a lot of things that I wanna learn.
- 🥰 Just do it, step by step!
